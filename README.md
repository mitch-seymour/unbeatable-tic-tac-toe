## About
In 2013, I went to an interview and was asked to build an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game in Python. After several years of collecting cyber dust, I found this program on an old machine and decided to post to github. There may be better ways to implement this, but I am keeping the code in its original form because hey, it's fun to look back on old code sometimes. Enjoy!

## README (Original)

This Tic-Tac-Toe game was written by Mitch Seymour, using Python 2.6.1

If you would like to see an implementation for another version of Python,
please email me at mitchseymour@gmail.com

To run the program, type the following command into your shell:

```bash
python play.py
```

Alternatively, you can add the appropriate python interpreter with 
a shebang at the beginning of play.py. for example:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python
```
The file must be executable if you choose this approach.

Also, if you prefer to view a cleaner version of the game, uncomment 
the following line from play.py

```bash
game.minimalMode()
```

This will remove the cell numbers (which are easy remember anyways) from
the board. 

Finally, I chose to implement this as a shell script using Python since, during
my interview, I was told that CMG is a python shop, and since there were 
a lot of questions relating to how I interact with unix systems from the 
commandline. However, if you would like this game implemented in some other
way, for example, as a web application, please let me know.

Thanks,

Mitch
