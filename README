This Tic-Tac-Toe game was written by Mitch Seymour, using Python 2.6.1

If you would like to see an implementation for another version of Python,
please email me at mitchseymour@gmail.com

To run the program, type the following command into your shell:

python play.py

Alternatively, you can add the appropriate python interpreter with 
a shebang at the beginning of play.py. for example:

#!/usr/bin/python

The file must be executable if you choose this approach.

Also, if you prefer to view a cleaner version of the game, uncomment 
the following line from play.py

game.minimalMode()

This will remove the cell numbers (which are easy remember anyways) from
the board. 

Finally, I chose to implement this as a shell script using Python since, during
my interview, I was told that CMG is a python shop, and since there were 
a lot of questions relating to how I interact with *nix systems from the 
commandline. However, if you would like this game implemented in some other
way, for example, as a web application, please let me know.

Thanks,

Mitch
